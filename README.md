## Application - 'math api'

Implement a web service (preferably in Go, Python, Ruby or Java; extra effort to do that in Go
will be recognised; using a framework or not):

- /min - given list of numbers and a quantifier (how many) provides min number(s)
- /max - given list of numbers and a quantifier (how many) provides max number(s)
- /avg - given list of numbers calculates their average
- /median - given list of numbers calculates their median
- /percentile - given list of numbers and quantifier 'q', compute the qth percentile of the list elements

No need to be concerned with resources, we're assuming there's plenty enough of memory, etc.
